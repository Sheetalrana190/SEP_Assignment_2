## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to practice analyzing and documenting requirements, including functional, non-functional, and system-based requirements, and verifying them with the client. Then to analyze the current status and push the project forward.

To achieve this task my approach will be as follow from lecture slide 6: Week-4-Analysis
Systems analysis activities  
- Gather detailed information:  Interviews, questionnaires, documents, observation of business practices, vendor research,
comments, suggestions
- Define requirements : Model functional and non-functional requirements
- Develop user interface dialogs : Interaction flow between user and system
- Evaluate Requirements with Users: User involvement, feedback, adapt to changes

## 1.2 Given Scenario
We are working with an AI developer who uses web scraping to generate training data. The client has specific needs and challenges regarding categorizing training questions and ensuring balanced data. 
After few meetings with the client we have able narrowed down to following needs and challenges.
## 1.3 Client's Needs and Challenges
### Training Questions
Developers want to have categorized training questions that are separate from the answers because developers care about self-affirmation.
### Balanced Training Data
Developers want to know that the training data they are using is "balanced" (does not contain biases) because this will give them better AI models.
